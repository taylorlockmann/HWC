# Human-Wildlife Conflict Project
#### Arnhold Environmental Graduate Fellow Program

## Project Overview and Objectives
Our primary objective for this project is to explore the different drivers of human-wildlife conflict (HWC), such as climate change and land use change, and understand how these drivers will impact the location and intensity of HWC in sub-Saharan Africa. We aim to identify potential hotspots for HWC by overlapping areas of high species probability of occurrence with high land use change.

## See  Fall 2021 Reproducibility folder for updated project code:

**chelsa_data_wrangling.R:** Crop CHELSA data to study area (Afrotropical region) and aggregate data.

**land_use_change_script.R:** Visualize the land use change between RCPs and SSPs in various years using GCAM-Demeter data.

**wallace_chelsa_run.Rmd:** R Markdown created from Wallace run.

**wrangle_occurrence_inputs.Rmd:** Create occurrence csv's for African lion, African savanna elephant, and African forest elephant (to read into Wallace).
